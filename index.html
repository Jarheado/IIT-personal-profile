    <div class="sectionTitle"><h1>Interests in IT</h1></div>
    <div class="sectionContent"
        <article>

        <p>Prior to taking the course in IT I have always been into computers and machines alike. My interest started
          with me loving to play on my computer and desire to build my own. The recent developements of technology
          and their programs as well as many youtubers building machines or projects for pure entertainment enticed me
          to find my career in the broad category of the technological world.
          In that time, I managed to acquire a job at Jaycar. This allowed me to learn a lot about the how a lot of the
          technology worked as well as pushing my interests further. My work colleges would often put in their extra time
          and effort to make displays for our work at home or whenever they had a break. Their projects ranged from 3D
          (3 Dimensional) printed sculptures such as a picture that was viewable when a torch was placed behind, games
          made on a raspberry pi and many other projects for themselves including an automated door closer for when the
          door is left open.Â 
          Understanding all the uses and the capability of coding pushed me to search for an education towards a career
          in IT. I searched for degrees in university or Tafe that could help me decide on a career or area of interest.
          I left a question for RMIT who quickly got back to me and helped me decide on a course to take between IT,
          cyber security, or both. As I was unsure on my abilities and time available, I chose IT for the possibility to
          move into cyber security in the future.
          I believe that taking this course will strengthen my understanding of IT, abilities, and show me more of the
          options available. I expect I will learn to use and understand coding languages and be able to use this course
          to grasp the inner workings of programs and their programming, so that I can understand how they work and to be
          able to make, improve or mimic my own programs. </p>

   <div class="sectionTitle"><h1>Ideal Job</h1></div>
   <div class="sectionContent"
   <article>
     <p>The position I would like to get for the moment, which I find to be an excellent starting point to a larger
        career opportunity is a Cyber analyst for the army. The position will give me strict and proper teaching towards
        cyber security, which is a field that I find fascinating. I want to be able understand the reasons for security
        risks to our electronics and how to stop them as security and privacy are something I value for all who use any
        electronics. The job is also another pathway to potentially finding a better job using the qualifications and
        experience given by the army as a valuable reference. The role can be entered without any experience or
        qualifications other than being 17 or over. The role can be entered unqualified or fully qualified. Preference
        will be given towards people who display skill, interest and experience relevant to ICT (Information and Communications Technology).
        The job is still a competitive application process which will require adequate competencies for the role.
        The period for trainees will have a lower income within their salary from $51,277 P.A. (per Annum) Full trained
        employees will have a base salary of $77,138. The minimal education allowed is completed year 10 of high
        schooling English, mathematics, or an equivalent education.
        Currently I have no qualifications other than completed schooling that will allow me to go into the role fully
        qualified. I hope to have the basics of the training already completed before entering the role.This should
        improve my chances of getting the role over others.
        I plan at minimum to gain my basics degrees in IT and ICT and choose a direction to focus on in Cyber security.
        Otherwise, I may decide to study and improve on my skill before applying for the role. <p>

    <div class="sectionTitle"><h1>Personal profile/Personality tests</h1></div>
    <article>
      <div class="personalitytests"<h2>Sixteen personality types</h2></div>
      <div class="sectionContent"
  <p>results: ENFJ-T</p>
  <p>These results show me that the actions and choices I have made can be made from my opinions of which is morally
    right or wrong. Shining light on the reasons for my decisions that I make and have made. They help me
    realise who I am as a person and what my strengths and weaknesses are. I plan to use this information to
    reflect and use to strengthen myself mentally and think rationally.
    I will be able to use the results to help distinguish a role for myself that I can use to strengthen myself
    in a team and the team as a whole. I will try to be a productive and a leading team member without trying
    to make all the decisions on a single standpoint basis.  I will try to help me team on every level mathematics
    I can and make sure no one is left behind with an open mind to hear their opinions.
    I should be able to use this information to help form an efficient team that will have minimised Personality
    clashes so that we can work efficiently and positively. I should use my understanding to create a team who
    looks forward to succeeding and putting in their all with the ability to communicate. Though I must let
    those who I partner up with decide on who they want to work with without trying to lead them to my
    ideal unfairly.</p>

   <div class="personalitytests"<h2>Learning style test</h2></div>
    <p>Results: Visual Learner </p>
    <p>I have always struggled to figure out what works best for me when learning as it felt as if I remembered
      and understood things with repetition and using different angles of understanding. The results allowed
      me to rethink about my own approach with more direct thinking. It helped me grasp my learning
      style as I approach understanding by visualising the process with a more physical understanding
      more than theoretical. I need to see a picture of something in my mind before fully coming
      to terms with an idea.</p>
    <p>This will allow me to communicate with my team on my ability to understand what they are trying to
      relay to me. It will require me to ask my team members for more assistance when trying to understand
      information that is not laid out easily for me. The results allow me to try recognizing my teams
      individual learning styles so that I can communicate easier with my peers.</p>
    <p>I will use my understanding of my learning abilities and comprehension of the different learning
      styles of others to try and form a team that will be able to communicate their ideas to try and suit
      everyone's learning styles while being able to use their own varied learning styles to form a team
      that can process information in a diverse productive manner.</p>

<div class="personalitytests"<h2>Emotional intelligence test</h2></div>
  <p>Results: Self-awareness = 4/10  Self-Management= 3/10  Social-Awareness 7/10  Relationship management= 5/10</p>
<p>I generally thought I had a decent Emotional Intelligence, but the questions of test helped me reflect
  on the choices I would genuinely make more in-depth. As each section of the test scored lower than I
  placed myself, I realise that I must work on myself and try to control my emotions. Understanding my
  lack of self-awareness alerts me to try on reflect on my actions and thoughts before they are acted
  upon. I need to work on my self-confidence, abilities, and limitations so that I am not held back
  by myself. My low score of self-management helped me reflect on my self-control with displaying
  my emotions around others in a more thought-out approach. Aswell as my need organise myself
  myself so that I can push myself to get tasks and obstacles out of the way easier.</p>
<p>I will try to contain myself within a team so that I can be more understanding, to push myself out to
  be more involved and inclusive so that there are less personality clashes. I will try to work around my
  disagreements with more empathy and push for a more friendly environment.</p>
<p>I will try to form a team that is formed by everyone and easily sociable. So that everyone can express
  themselves so that it will be easier to understand everyone's emotions and views on topics when
  discussing them. Getting a team that will be easily social will help break down barriers and lead for
  more in-depth discussions.<p>
