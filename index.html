        <p>My name is Jared I am an aspiring IT (Information Technology) student of RMIT (Royal Melbourne institute
          of Technology). I am starting my journey again into the world of education after the 2 years of breakup
          from the schooling system to set myself up for the future ahead (as well as the hindrance of covid).
          I moved away from my hometown after graduating year 12 to re-evaluate myself and what I wanted to do
           for the future. Using the extra free time, I had I began to pick up hobbies and interests i was not
           able to do from my old home. I went out to buy my first skateboard being unsure if I was going to be interested
           and invested enough to learn. The first few days were like learning to walk again with my balance completely
           off for every new movement I tried. Although I still feel like a novice to the sport and have much to
           learn, it has become the most peaceful, calming, and fun activities that I am dedicated to mastering.
           Skateboarding allowed me to strengthen my physical abilities, clear my mind when needed, as well as
           understanding how to express myself internally and externally. Using my love for skateboard art and the board itself
           to express myself within the sport by using the skills I had learned and the art I use to convey
           my love for the sport and emotions.</p>

    <div class="sectionTitle"><h2>Interests in IT</h2></div>
    <div class="sectionContent">
        <article>

        <p>Prior to taking the course in IT I have always been into computers and machines alike. My interest started
          with me loving to play on my computer and desire to build my own. The recent developements of technology
          and their programs as well as many youtubers building machines or projects for pure entertainment enticed me
          to find my career in the broad category of the technological world.
          In that time, I managed to acquire a job at Jaycar. This allowed me to learn a lot about the how a lot of the
          technology worked as well as pushing my interests further. My work colleges would often put in their extra time
          and effort to make displays for our work at home or whenever they had a break. Their projects ranged from 3D
          (3 Dimensional) printed sculptures such as a picture that was viewable when a torch was placed behind, games
          made on a raspberry pi and many other projects for themselves including an automated door closer for when the
          door is left open.Â 
          Understanding all the uses and the capability of coding pushed me to search for an education towards a career
          in IT. I searched for degrees in university or Tafe that could help me decide on a career or area of interest.
          I left a question for RMIT who quickly got back to me and helped me decide on a course to take between IT,
          cyber security, or both. As I was unsure on my abilities and time available, I chose IT for the possibility to
          move into cyber security in the future.
          I believe that taking this course will strengthen my understanding of IT, abilities, and show me more of the
          options available. I expect I will learn to use and understand coding languages and be able to use this course
          to grasp the inner workings of programs and their programming, so that I can understand how they work and to be
          able to make, improve or mimic my own programs. </p>

   <div class="sectionContent">
     <p>The position I would like to get for the moment, which I find to be an excellent starting point to a larger
        career opportunity is a Cyber analyst for the army. The position will give me strict and proper teaching towards
        cyber security, which is a field that I find fascinating. I want to be able understand the reasons for security
        risks to our electronics and how to stop them as security and privacy are something I value for all who use any
        electronics. The job is also another pathway to potentially finding a better job using the qualifications and
        experience given by the army as a valuable reference. The role can be entered without any experience or
        qualifications other than being 17 or over. The role can be entered unqualified or fully qualified. Preference
        will be given towards people who display skill, interest and experience relevant to ICT (Information and Communications Technology).
        The job is still a competitive application process which will require adequate competencies for the role.
        The period for trainees will have a lower income within their salary from $51,277 P.A. (per Annum) Full trained
        employees will have a base salary of $77,138. The minimal education allowed is completed year 10 of high
        schooling English, mathematics, or an equivalent education.
        Currently I have no qualifications other than completed schooling that will allow me to go into the role fully
        qualified. I hope to have the basics of the training already completed before entering the role.This should
        improve my chances of getting the role over others.
        I plan at minimum to gain my basics degrees in IT and ICT and choose a direction to focus on in Cyber security.
        Otherwise, I may decide to study and improve on my skill before applying for the role. <p>

    <div class="sectionTitle"><h2>Personal profile/Personality tests</h2></div>
    <article>
      <div class="personalitytests"<h3>Sixteen personality types</h3></div>
      <div class="sectionContent">
  <p>results: ENFJ-T</p>
  <p>These results show me that the actions and choices I have made can be made from my opinions of which is morally
    right or wrong. Shining light on the reasons for my decisions that I make and have made. They help me
    realise who I am as a person and what my strengths and weaknesses are. I plan to use this information to
    reflect and use to strengthen myself mentally and think rationally.
    I will be able to use the results to help distinguish a role for myself that I can use to strengthen myself
    in a team and the team as a whole. I will try to be a productive and a leading team member without trying
    to make all the decisions on a single standpoint basis.  I will try to help me team on every level mathematics
    I can and make sure no one is left behind with an open mind to hear their opinions.
    I should be able to use this information to help form an efficient team that will have minimised Personality
    clashes so that we can work efficiently and positively. I should use my understanding to create a team who
    looks forward to succeeding and putting in their all with the ability to communicate. Though I must let
    those who I partner up with decide on who they want to work with without trying to lead them to my
    ideal unfairly.</p>

   <div class="personalitytests"<h3>Learning style test</h3></div>
    <p>Results: Visual Learner </p>
    <p>I have always struggled to figure out what works best for me when learning as it felt as if I remembered
      and understood things with repetition and using different angles of understanding. The results allowed
      me to rethink about my own approach with more direct thinking. It helped me grasp my learning
      style as I approach understanding by visualising the process with a more physical understanding
      more than theoretical. I need to see a picture of something in my mind before fully coming
      to terms with an idea.</p>
    <p>This will allow me to communicate with my team on my ability to understand what they are trying to
      relay to me. It will require me to ask my team members for more assistance when trying to understand
      information that is not laid out easily for me. The results allow me to try recognizing my teams
      individual learning styles so that I can communicate easier with my peers.</p>
    <p>I will use my understanding of my learning abilities and comprehension of the different learning
      styles of others to try and form a team that will be able to communicate their ideas to try and suit
      everyone's learning styles while being able to use their own varied learning styles to form a team
      that can process information in a diverse productive manner.</p>

<div class="personalitytests"<h3>Emotional intelligence test</h3></div>
  <p>Results: Self-awareness = 4/10  Self-Management= 3/10  Social-Awareness 7/10  Relationship management= 5/10</p>
<p>I generally thought I had a decent Emotional Intelligence, but the questions of test helped me reflect
  on the choices I would genuinely make more in-depth. As each section of the test scored lower than I
  placed myself, I realise that I must work on myself and try to control my emotions. Understanding my
  lack of self-awareness alerts me to try on reflect on my actions and thoughts before they are acted
  upon. I need to work on my self-confidence, abilities, and limitations so that I am not held back
  by myself. My low score of self-management helped me reflect on my self-control with displaying
  my emotions around others in a more thought-out approach. Aswell as my need organise myself
  myself so that I can push myself to get tasks and obstacles out of the way easier.</p>
<p>I will try to contain myself within a team so that I can be more understanding, to push myself out to
  be more involved and inclusive so that there are less personality clashes. I will try to work around my
  disagreements with more empathy and push for a more friendly environment.</p>
<p>I will try to form a team that is formed by everyone and easily sociable. So that everyone can express
  themselves so that it will be easier to understand everyone's emotions and views on topics when
  discussing them. Getting a team that will be easily social will help break down barriers and lead for
  more in-depth discussions.<p>

     <div class="sectionTitle"><h2>Project Idea</h2></div>
     <article>
       <div class="sectionContent">
  <p>A project I believe would be worth investing in is an application that will be used for people to talk with and will respond similar to a person. It will be used as a therapy app for people who cannot afford a therapist or do not want to see a therapist for other reasons. It other uses will be used to build basic communication skills for people who are introverted or shy. It will have a texting feature and a talking feature that will listen to a person and respond by talking in its own voice.</p>
<p>The projects goal is to assist people who are going through hardships, who need emotional support, or others who
  could use a hand improving their communication skills. Many people are unable to make friends or keep healthy
  relationships. I believe that an application that people can interact/ speak with will help their mental
  situation and help them out of depression. Many people desire to talk to others but due to anxiety or
  their mental situation decide not to. An application that people can talk with will allow people to break
  through barriers of their own design gain a sense of strength back in their lives. After using the application
  the should become more confident and encouraged to make relationships and communicate with others,
   giving them a more healthy and positive attitude.</p>
<p>The program will be an AI (artificial intelligence) able to act as a partner or friend depending on the
  users selection. For people who need assistance after a breakup or those who struggle to find a
  connection, the AI will allow them to recover and understand how to push forward properly. For
  others it will help them to improve on their conversation making skills so they can make friends or
  improve their situation with their friends. The AI will learn to respond to users through their
  conversations and improve upon its responses. The AI will be able to learn and understand
  conversations enough that it will be able to make emotional and impactful responses to the user.
  TheÂ AI will be able to respond to flirtatious comments or sad ones, giving advice that feels less
  scripted and more natural so the user can believe they are talking to a real person. The AI will be
  able to ask questions before the start of a conversation and be able to ask basic open-ended
  questions for the user to respond to. When responding to questions such as âHow are you today?â
  the AIÂ will respond similarly to âMy day has been great. I went for a walk today to the beach and
  relaxed. How is your day?â </p>
<p>TheÂ AI will have multiple avatars that the user can select from, so the user can see who they are
  talking to with less feeling like a text or phone call. The user will be able to modify the clothing and
  general style of the model. This will allow them to feel more relatable with the avatar or be used as
  aÂ creative outlet. The model when in speech mode will be able to express emotion and move its
  mouth as it talks. This will help give it a more natural feel to help comfort and relate when it speaks
  to the program. The user will be able to select from a variety of voices of that which the user desires.</p>
<p>The Program will also offer and recommend services such as suicide hotline, therapists, and other
  social services. The ProgramÂ will have a quality response systemÂ that allows you to mark every
  comment the AI makes. The system will allow you to display how comments make you feel and will
  affect the way the AI responds, avoiding or including more responses similar. This system will
  educate the AI on its responses and allow the algorithm to improve upon itself. Some activities and
  surveys used in activities will be available on the application. These will be used to find interests,
  hobbies, likes, dislikes, and general conversation points. Other activities that will allow the user to
  gain communication skills.</p>
<p>The program will also have a function to select pre-made comments and emotional status icons so
  that the AI will be able to try and resolve your emotions or allow users to vent.</p>
<p>The program will require a highly advanced AI structure. Open AI GPT-3 would be an option to begin on
  the program though the program will most likely need to be made in-house by a development crew either
  from scratch or a combination of various open AI learning sources. The Application will be hosted
  on a server which will give it the processing power and memory used to work. Aswell as using the users'
  inputs to improve upon the design. The software will not be completed as there will always be need for
  improvements, though the goal of a realistic conversation with an AI is very achievable. </p>
<p>Crafting such a program will require specialists from many areas to achieve the goal. The roles will
  need individuals with diverse specialities or those who are competent in many. The project will need
  programmers, who are competent enough in computer sciences to code the project correctly. The
  roles and skills needed will be found in those with computer science, statistics, applied mathematics,
  and neuroscience degrees. The roles will be reasonable to fill though the learning process of creating
  an AI will be group effort all those roles. The teams skills will be first learnt by understanding other
  various AI programs. The hardware needed will be high-performance, high-end equipment that will
  be suitable to keep up and advance the development of the AI.</p>
<p>If the project is successful, it will allow us to help many who suffer from depression and other mentally
  situations. This will also allow for more investment and study into AI allowing for more investigation and
  understanding of the field. A successful approach to this project would undeniably affect many and
  pave the way for more AI based services designed to help people in need. The increasingly advancing
  field of AI has various areas that could eventually be integrated together with this research around
  push for more advanced and varied AI. </p>
